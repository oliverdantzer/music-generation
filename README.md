# music-generation

## Description

The goal of this project was to predict the notes given the beat and note times of classical music songs, and generate new songs using the predicted notes and the timings.

## Methods

I used a decision tree regression model, and fit to the the [musicnet dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/musicnet-dataset "musicnet dataset").
